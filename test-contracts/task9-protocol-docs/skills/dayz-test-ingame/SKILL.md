# DayZ test in-game (filepatching launch)

## WHAT THIS DOES

Closes the dev loop for a DayZ mod on a single Windows box: re-pack the PBO, deploy it
where the engine reads mods, and launch `DayZDiag_x64.exe` with `-filePatching` so script
and config edits are picked up without re-binarizing. Three launch modes (offline / server /
client / all) driven by one orchestrator script and double-click `.bat` wrappers, generated
per mod into `<Mod>_dev\tools\`.

## SOURCE OF TRUTH

`<dayz-projects>\DAYZ_INFRA.md` is the canonical record of
this user's DayZ paths, flags and gotchas, verified in-situ. This skill **operationalizes**
that doc — it does not re-derive the flags. If the two ever disagree, DAYZ_INFRA.md wins;
update the skill to match, never the reverse.

Cite-then-verify discipline:
- `[EXACT]` — flag/path verified against DAYZ_INFRA.md (section refs below; section names are
  stable, line numbers drift as the doc grows) and the user's RPTs.
- `[DESIGN]` — plausible but NOT in the user's infra. The single-exe **offline mode is
  `[DESIGN]`** — validate it in-game on first run before trusting it.

## WHEN TO USE / WHEN NOT

Use when the user wants to see a mod running in-game, iterate scripts/configs live, or stand
up a local server+client. Do NOT use to author the mod (that is `dayz-model-pipeline` /
`enforce-script-reference`), to validate/pack only (`dayz-pbo-build`), or to configure a
production server. The retail `DayZ_x64.exe` is for final pre-release validation only —
default to the diag exe. Retail es manual-only y externo a este launcher.

## PROTOCOLO DE SESIÓN COMPARTIDA

Leer antes de lanzar:
`C:\Users\guill\ObsidianVault\AI\20_Runbooks\dayz-mcp-agent-session-protocol.md`.
El launcher oficial es Diag-only y aplica esta matriz:

| Ruta | Ejecutable / rol | Contrato |
|---|---|---|
| Diag gestionado | `DayZDiag_x64.exe`, incluido el rol `-server` | `managed_lifecycle=true`; requiere lease y `run_id`. |
| Servidor dedicado | `DayZServer_x64.exe` | `managed_lifecycle=false`; probe-gated y no lo inicia el launcher oficial. |
| Retail manual externo | Sesión abierta por el usuario fuera del launcher | Sin lifecycle de agente; activa cuarentena. |

1. Ejecuta `session_status`; con cuarentena retail solo se permiten lecturas.
2. Para launch, stop o cualquier mutación: `session_acquire` → `session_wait` (máximo 30 s por
   llamada) → uso. Renueva con `session_heartbeat` solo durante trabajo exclusivo activo.
3. El caller entrega lifecycle mediante `DAYZ_MCP_CLIENT_ID_JSON` y
   `DAYZ_MCP_LEASE_TOKEN`, solo en su entorno; nunca copies sus valores a argv, logs o handoff.
4. Conserva el `run_id` devuelto. El mismo mod no concede ownership: stop/adopt requieren el
   run exacto. `-Kill` sin `-RunId` queda fail-closed.
5. Termina con `session_release` y `session_status`. NUNCA sustituyas el lifecycle guard por
   un kill o por atribución basada en nombre, mod, cmdline o perfil.

Retail manual-only activa cuarentena retail: el usuario que lo abrió lo cierra por la UI y
después ejecuta doctor/rescan. Sin acceso a esa UI, declarar `manual_cleanup_required`; otro
agente no mata ni adopta el proceso.

## PREREQUISITES (preflight — runs automatically)

The orchestrator checks these every run and fixes what it safely can. Verified on this box
2026-05-30: missions present in DayZServer, AddonBuilder present, `P:\` mounted, but
`P:\Mods` junction NOT yet created and `DAYZ_*` env vars unset (fallbacks used).

- **Diag exe** — `DayZDiag_x64.exe`. Client AND server MUST be the diag binary; retail blocks
  past the loading screen with `-filePatching`. [EXACT — DAYZ_INFRA.md §Diag binary obligatorio para iteración]
- **`P:\Mods` junction** -> `<DayZ>\!Workshop` so deployed PBOs land where the engine looks.
  The script creates it via `mklink /J` if missing (no admin needed). [EXACT — DAYZ_INFRA.md §Layout de drives y mods]
- **`allowFilePatching = 1`** in the server's `serverDZ.cfg`, else BattlEye kicks the client
  with `0x00020005`. The script generates a dev `serverDZ.cfg` with it set. [EXACT — DAYZ_INFRA.md §serverDZ.cfg — allowFilePatching = 1; obligatorio]
- **Mission template** — absolute path; the server loads an empty mission otherwise.
  [EXACT — DAYZ_INFRA.md §Comandos de invocación canónicos — Server diag]. Aliases:
  `chernarus`/`livonia`/`sakhal`. [EXACT — DAYZ_INFRA.md §Mission templates — aliases canónicos]
- **AddonBuilder** — only when `-Build`. [EXACT — DAYZ_INFRA.md §Comandos de invocación canónicos — AddonBuilder]

Path resolution is env-var-first, Steam-default fallback (`DAYZ_GAME_PATH`, `DAYZ_DIAG_PATH`,
`DAYZ_TOOLS_PATH`, `DAYZ_WORK_DRIVE`). [EXACT — DAYZ_INFRA.md §Variables de entorno opcionales (resolvers)]

## THE CYCLE

1. **Build + deploy** (`-Build`) — `AddonBuilder P:\<Mod> -> P:\Mods\@<Mod>\Addons\<Mod>.pbo`.
   Required whenever **assets** (`.p3d`, `.paa`, `.rvmat`) change — filepatching does not
   reliably hot-load binarized models/textures.
   **Scripts-only mods**: AddonBuilder's default binarize mode drops `.c` files (not in its
   include-list) → a config-only PBO where the mod mounts but no script runs. `Invoke-Build`
   now auto-adds `-packonly` when the source has no `.p3d`/`.paa` (force with `-PackOnly`), and
   warns if a mod with a `scripts\` folder packs suspiciously small. [verified 2026-06-03]
   **`.asi`/`.anm` (added 2026-06-24, A6_SR2M)**: binarize mode ALSO drops these unless the
   `-include` list has `*.asi;*.anm`. A weapon with a custom player anim graph
   (`AddItemInHandsProfileIK` 2nd arg = its own `.asi`) then builds WITHOUT the graph → the
   reference points at a missing file and the change (e.g. a fire-anim no-jump fix) is silently
   absent (the build still reports success). The generated include list must contain
   `*.asi;*.anm`. Verify the `.asi`/`.anm` shows up as a FILE ENTRY in the PBO header, not just
   as a string inside the compiled script.
2. **Launch** — diag exe in the chosen mode. **Script/config** edits (`.c`, `.cpp`) are then
   picked up live by `-filePatching` without re-packing.

So: edit a model -> re-run with `-Build`. Edit a script -> just relaunch (or even keep the
client running, depending on what changed).

## MODES

| Mode | What | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `all` (default) | server, wait for UDP bind, then client | [EXACT — DAYZ_INFRA.md §Comandos de invocación canónicos — Server diag + Cliente diag] |
| `server` | `DayZDiag_x64.exe` gestionado con `-server` | `managed_lifecycle=true`; [EXACT — DAYZ_INFRA.md §Comandos de invocación canónicos — Server diag] |
| `client` | diag `-connect=127.0.0.1` (server already up) | [EXACT — DAYZ_INFRA.md §Comandos de invocación canónicos — Cliente diag] |
| `offline` | single diag with `-mission`, no network | **[DESIGN]** validate in-game |

## RETAIL EXTERNO MANUAL PARA MODSETS DE TERCEROS (histórico verificado 2026-06-11)

The diag exe compiled Enforce in STRICT mode; the retail chain compiled permissively.
Third-party packs were observed with syntax that retail tolerated as `FIX-ME` warnings but
diag rejected as fatal errors — verified live with the A6 weapons pack (braceless
one-liners: `override typename GetInputType() return X;` in OpticScripts/WeaponScripts,
"Missing function scope") and LBmaster_Core ("Unsafe down-casting"). This remained a
diagnostic fact, not an alternate launcher path. The agent's role is limited to reporting
the incompatibility; the user owns any decision to open retail manually outside this
orchestrator. While an external retail route is open, the agent remains in cuarentena
retail and read-only under the protocol.

Historical manual-route facts retained for diagnosis:

- **Retail server was `DayZServer_x64.exe` from the dedicated install.** In the observed
  session, the retail game exe with `-server` booted the CE and then terminated while
  loading GFX resources (`Water/*.edds`, "Termination successfully completed").
- **The dedicated binary already operated as a server.** Adding `-server` also triggered
  LBmaster's startup check (`Error: Remove Startup Parameter: -server`).
- **The historical LBmaster setup loaded server-only addons through `-serverMod=`.** Its
  `*_Server.pbo` files had been placed under `@SomeFolder\addons\*.pbo`, and their paths
  had resolved absolutely in the same way as `-mod` paths.
- The launcher's bind-wait produced a false negative ("exited before binding") while the
  server was still booting the CE. In that session, the first CE boot of the large pack
  took minutes and the later UDP 2302 observation showed that startup had continued.

**BattlEye on the retail pair — kick 240 "Game restart required"** (session 2026-06-11):

- The retail server loaded its BE module (`profiles\BattlEye\BEServer_x64.dll`,
  auto-downloaded on its first BE boot) and kicked clients that had not initialized BE,
  including the bare `DayZ_x64.exe` client from that session. `BattlEye = 0;` in
  serverDZ.cfg masked the behavior for several sessions, then stopped doing so after a
  system-wide BE service hot-update under `%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Common Files\BattlEye`.
  The recorded file times identified that update, after which kick 240 returned 20-60 s
  after each connection regardless of the cfg flag.
- When `BEServer_x64.dll` was removed or renamed in the 1.29 dedicated installation, the
  server bound UDP, printed `BattlEye initialization failed`, and shut down cleanly about
  a minute later ("Termination successfully completed" in the RPT). The sequence looked
  like a healthy boot followed by a silent death.
- In the historical external-manual setup, with server BE intact, `DayZ_BE.exe`
  initialized the client handshake and avoided the kick. The in-game session on
  2026-06-11 reached spawn, equip and inventory with zero kicks. This launcher did not
  invoke that route; the user owned its UI lifecycle and the agent remained in
  quarantine/read-only.

Historical load-order failures that cost a session:

- Removing `@CF` from BaseMods while `@VPPAdminTools` remained caused VPP's embedded CF
  sources to fail with `Unknown type 'RPCManager'`.
- LBmaster operated only when the observed setup included client PBOs (`LBmaster_Core`
  plus the matching client of every `*_Server.pbo`, such as `LBmaster_Groups` for
  `AdvancedGroups_Server`), the server-side PBOs and a per-IP license whitelist. Its
  error log contained the corresponding whitelist URL. In the historical local weapon
  sessions, VPP served as the admin/spawner and LBmaster appeared only in parity runs.
- The historical `@A6_TestPack` subset had been staged with filesystem hardlinks from
  `@LFTEST`; it represented 13 weapon PBOs without duplicate file copies.

## USAGE

Orchestrator (from `<Mod>_dev\tools\`):

```powershell
# build, deploy, run server+client on Chernarus
.\dayz-test.ps1 -Mod HiddenBase -Mode all -Build

# script-only change: relaunch client, no re-pack
.\dayz-test.ps1 -Mod HiddenBase -Mode client

# offline eyeball of a model [DESIGN]
.\dayz-test.ps1 -Mod HiddenBase -Mode offline -Build

# another map + an extra dependency on top of the defaults (CF/Dabs/VPP)
.\dayz-test.ps1 -Mod LFPowerGrid -Mode all -Build -Mission livonia -ExtraMods "@RaG_Liquid_Framework"

# preflight only / stop one exact managed run
.\dayz-test.ps1 -Mod HiddenBase -Preflight
.\dayz-test.ps1 -Mod HiddenBase -Kill -RunId <run_id>
```

Key params: `-Mod` (required), `-Mode`, `-Mission`, `-Build`/`-Clean`, `-ExtraMods`,
`-BaseMods`/`-NoBaseMods` (see below), `-Source` (default `P:\<Mod>`), `-RunId`,
`-NoFilePatching`, `-Port`, `-PlayerName`, `-ServerWait`. Double-click wrappers:
`server.bat` (all+build), `client.bat`, `offline.bat`.

## DEFAULT MODS & ADMIN TOOLS

Every launch prepends three base mods (load order, CF leftmost — folder names verified in this
user's `!Workshop`): `@CF;@Dabs Framework;@VPPAdminTools`. The mod under test and `-ExtraMods`
load after them. Override with `-BaseMods "..."`, or drop them entirely with `-NoBaseMods`.

`@VPPAdminTools` gives in-game admin tools (teleport, spawn, godmode, object editing) for
testing. Admin access is by **SteamID64**, not a server password — but the on-disk layout
differs across VPP versions, and the installed one uses the `Permissions\` folder, NOT the root
`SuperAdmins.json`. Because this script isolates `-profiles`, the preflight seeds **both** so
admin works regardless of version (idempotent; an already-hashed password is never clobbered):

- `<server profiles>\VPPAdminTools\Permissions\SuperAdmins\SuperAdmins.txt` — one SteamID64 per
  line; the file the installed VPP actually reads. (verified in-situ 2026-06-09)
- `<server profiles>\VPPAdminTools\Permissions\credentials.txt` — the **in-game login
  password** on line 1. VPP hashes it on first boot and the raw is then lost. Seeded from
  `-AdminPass` (default `dayzadmin`); the preflight prints it once — store it.
- `<server profiles>\VPPAdminTools\SuperAdmins.json` — `{ "SUPER_ADMINS": ["<SteamID64>"] }`,
  the legacy layout; still seeded for older VPP builds that read it.

SteamID source: `-AdminSteamId`, else reused from the retail config at
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\DayZ\VPPAdminTools\SuperAdmins.json`. In-game: open the VPP menu (key set under
Options → Controls; VPP's common default is Insert), then log in with the password. To change
admin or password later, edit the files above and restart the server.

**No-password dev default (verified vs VPP source 2026-06-09):** the generated `serverDZ.cfg`
sets `vppDisablePassword = 1;`, so VPP skips the login password entirely — a superadmin (SteamID
in `SuperAdmins.txt`) gets access with NO password (`missionServer.c:14` →
`DisablePasswordProtection(true)`; granted because `HasUserGroup`→`IsSuperAdmin`,
`PermissionManager.c:693`). This is the robust local-dev default: the `credentials.txt` password
path repeatedly failed across sessions (SHA256/version quirks), and disabling it removes that
whole failure class. The seeded `credentials.txt` password only matters if you remove
`vppDisablePassword` (for password-gated testing). In-game keys: End = toggle admin, Home = open
menu (rebind under Options → Controls if a fresh client profile lost them).

Earlier this doc claimed VPP reads the root `SuperAdmins.json` — that was wrong for the installed
build (it reads `Permissions\`), which is why admin silently failed until 2026-06-09.

The dev `serverDZ.cfg` sets `verifySignatures = 0`, so VPP's signed PBO loads without registering
its `.bikey`.

## GENERATING THE SCRIPTS FOR A MOD

1. Create `<Mod>_dev\tools\` if absent (per the dev-split layout in workflow.md).
2. Copy `templates\dayz-test.ps1` there verbatim — it is fully generic (driven by `-Mod`).
3. Copy the three `.bat` wrappers and replace the `__MODNAME__` placeholder with the real mod
   name (the CfgPatches identifier — no dashes; `Mi_Mod`, not `Mi-Mod`). [EXACT — DAYZ_INFRA.md §Layout de drives y mods — Naming de mods]
4. Confirm the mod **source** is reachable at `P:\<Mod>` (a junction to the editable folder)
   or pass `-Source`. Confirm `requiredAddons` in `config.cpp` map to the `-ExtraMods` you
   pass (CF, Expansion, etc.) — the client and server mod lists MUST match.

The `.ps1` is self-contained (no dependency on this skill at runtime) so it stays valid in the
mod repo even if the skill changes. `_server\` and `_client\` workspaces (serverDZ.cfg, RPT,
script.log) are created next to `tools\` under `<Mod>_dev\`.

## FILEPATCHING SCOPE — read before promising hot-reload

`-filePatching` hot-loads **scripts and configs** from raw source, not binarized assets.
Model/texture/material changes need a `-Build`. Do not tell the user "just edit and it
reloads" for a `.p3d` or `.paa` change — that is the most common false expectation here.

## MOD PATHS MUST BE ABSOLUTE — silent no-mount otherwise (verified 2026-06-01)

A bare `-mod=@Name` is resolved by the engine **relative to its working directory** (the game
dir), i.e. `<DayZ>\@Name`. Deployed mods live under `<DayZ>\!Workshop\@Name`, so that relative
path does not exist and the engine **silently fails to mount the addon** — its `CfgPatches` /
`CfgVehicles` classes never register, and `CreateObjectEx` later returns **null with no RPT
error**. This is a brutal failure mode: the server boots, the mission runs, nothing logs wrong,
but your mod's classes simply aren't there.

Verified via an in-mission `ConfigIsExisting("CfgPatches LFQuad")` probe on a headless `-server`:
- `-mod=@LFQuad` (relative, cwd=game) → `CfgPatches.LFQuad = 0` (absent).
- `-mod=C:\...\DayZ\!Workshop\@LFQuad` (absolute) → `CfgPatches.LFQuad = 1`, `LFQuad_base = 1`.

`Get-ModString` now rewrites every bare `@Name` to its absolute `!Workshop` path via
`Resolve-ModToken` (handles names with spaces like `@Dabs Framework`; passes through tokens that
are already rooted or not found under `!Workshop`). This applies to server, client and offline.

Caveats (honest scope — not yet verified):
- The probe only confirmed the **mod-under-test** mount. Whether base mods mount under relative
  names in the `all` mode (client present) was NOT isolated — the fix makes it moot by resolving
  all of them to absolute.
- Checking a dependency's mount needs its **real CfgPatches name**, not the folder name:
  `@CF` → `JM_CF_Scripts` (verified by extracting `@CF\addons\scripts.pbo`). A probe using `"CF"`
  yields a false negative.

### Headless autotest pattern (no client, scripted spawn)

For automated physics/spawn testing without a human client, a dedicated harness lives at
`LFQuad_dev\tools\dayz-autotest.ps1` (reuses this launcher's build+deploy). Three gotchas that
cost many iterations, recorded so the next headless harness works first try:
1. **Historical detached pattern — superseded 2026-07-15.** A direct `Start-Process` avoided
   waiting on the DayZDiag grandchild but left it outside the registered lifecycle. Launch now
   exclusively through the managed Diag launcher after acquiring the lease; retain its `run_id`
   and poll the RPT read-only. Do not recreate the old direct invocation.
2. **A test mission `init.c` should skip `CreateHive()`** (CE economy) for a physics test — it
   loads ~20k loot items and delays the mission loop by minutes.
3. **A `CarScript` vehicle only ticks `OnUpdate` / simulates with a player present.** A headless
   server with zero clients won't drive the vehicle's own script; spawn after a client connects
   (the harness has a `-WithClient` mode that connects a second diag instance to 127.0.0.1).

## WHEEL SIMULATION DIAGNOSIS (vehicle won't drive / bounces / sinks)

When a modded `CarScript` vehicle spawns but won't drive - wheels mount yet don't
spin, chassis bounces or sinks, engine revs with no speed - the failure is almost
always one of two MEASURABLE things, not mass/inertia. Instrument and read them
side-by-side against a known-good reference vehicle (e.g. the vanilla sedan or the
Croco quadbike) IN THE SAME RUN before touching geometry.

### 1. Is the wheel seated in PhysX, and does it touch ground?

- `WheelCountPresent()` - how many wheels the simulation actually seated (the gate).
  `0` while `WheelCount()` returns N means the slot/FireGeometry wiring is wrong; see
  the `enforce-script-reference` wheel-attachment rule and audit check SP-017.
- `WheelHasContact(i)` per wheel - `1` = touching ground, `0` = airborne. Print the
  four as a bitstring (`wc=1111` good; `wc=0000` = the whole vehicle is suspended off
  the ground, a placement/clearance problem, not a sim problem). Vanilla refs:
  `car.c:297,349,352`.

So: `WheelCountPresent()=0` is the silent wheel-binding blocker (FireGeometry slot
selection); `WheelCountPresent()=4` with `wc=0000` is geometry sitting too high or
buried, which step 2 isolates.

### 2. Did placement bury or launch the vehicle? (controlled-height probe)

Spawn with an explicit height flag instead of letting CE drop it:
- `ECE_KEEPHEIGHT` (`=524288`, "no surface trace") - places at the exact Y you pass,
  no terrain snap. Spawn a known clear height and watch whether it settles.
- `ECE_PLACE_ON_SURFACE` (`=1060`) - normal surface-trace placement.
Vanilla refs: `centraleconomy.c:37,27`. If the vehicle is stable under KEEPHEIGHT but
bounces/sinks under PLACE_ON_SURFACE, the bug is placement burying the hull (wheel-well
clearance vs tire radius - audit check SP-023), not the model.

### 3. Gotcha: parser/instrumentation drift before declaring the test failed

When the harness reports "ERROR / no data", first confirm the parser regex still
matches the CURRENT log-line format of the instrumentation. A log-format change
(renamed tag, reordered fields) reads as a test failure when the test actually ran
fine. Check the regex against a raw sample line before concluding the build is broken.

| Script edit doesn't take effect — the same compile error persists across rebuilds even though the source is fixed on disk | AddonBuilder's incremental sync to `P:\temp\<Mod>` served stale source (a changed `.c` not re-copied); filePatching also did not override the PBO's scripts with the loose work-drive copies | Invoke-Build now wipes `P:\temp\<Mod>` before every build; building AddonBuilder by hand, pass `-clear` or delete the temp first.

Logs (where to look): `script.log` = script compile/runtime errors; `*.RPT` = engine errors
(missing assets, malformed configs); `crash_*.log` = handled exceptions, not hard segfaults.
[EXACT — DAYZ_INFRA.md §Cuándo cita el RPT que un script falla]. All under the `_server\profiles\` and `_client\profiles\`
folders. For a structured script-failure diagnosis, hand off to `dayz-mod-workflow`.

## OUT OF SCOPE

Authoring the mod, production server config, Central Economy / persistence tuning beyond the
minimal dev `serverDZ.cfg`, signing for Workshop release. PBO validation/packaging internals
live in `dayz-pbo-build` — this skill calls AddonBuilder, it does not re-implement the checks.

Per-session in-game gotchas moved to `references/session-findings.md`; load it when a launch hits one of these. One line each:

- **LFSlidingFloor (2026-06-11)** — `Print()`->script.log not RPT; `-filePatching` can compile WITHOUT the mod's scripts silently; VPP needs `@CF` first; 1 Steam acct = 1 client (kick 179); deployed PBO locked while server runs.
- **A6_SR2M grip (2026-06-17)** — visual capture on retail (brightness band, specular glint, exposure drift, multi-config desync, RPT error filter) + `Start-Process EPERM uv_spawn` in a backtick `foreach`.
- **MercedesAMGLF Fase 0 (2026-06-22)** — cheap mount-probe gate (CfgPatches existence) before physics autotest; retargeting the LFQuad physics harness (server-only no-spawn, phantom debug token, control-vehicle verdict, case-insensitive `-replace`).
- **Retargeting the harness to a new mod (2026-06-23)** — `dayz-test.ps1` is car-parametric (copy verbatim); only per-mod helpers need a case-sensitive token swap; retarget host-direct.
- **The box is a coordinated resource (2026-06-24, superseded 2026-07-15)** — one DayZ instance per box (UDP 2302); FIFO lease serializes mutations and `run_id` exacto identifica lifecycle; nombres de mod/perfil no conceden ownership.
- **`@<Mod>_deps` separate dep addon (2026-06-26)** — put deps in `-BaseMods` (loads first) or the client fails `Unknown type` at compile; replicate the last successful `-mod=` from the RPT.
- **Third-party "sloppy" scripts (2026-06-28)** — deps that only warn on retail but fatal-compile on diag require a user-owned external manual parity run; agent stays in quarantine.
- **Launching DayZDiag from the agent (2026-06-28, superseded 2026-07-15)** — background tool-jobs can lose their child; use the Diag-only managed launcher and its exact run instead of an unmanaged process.

## Backups (.bak_*) in scripts/ inflate the PBO and break grep-verify (SP-065, added 2026-07-14)

`Invoke-Build -packonly` copies the mod tree AS-IS, so any `<file>.c.bak_*` left next to the `.c` (the OneDrive rule: back up before editing) gets packed into the PBO. It does not break the game (Enforce compiles only `*.c`, ignores `.bak_*`), but it (a) inflates the PBO and (b) breaks PBO verification by grep-of-the-blob - an old anchor reads as PRESENT because it lives in a `.bak`, not the active `.c`. Measured (LFHeli 2026-07-14): 827,593 bytes with 29 `.bak` inside vs 115,609 bytes after moving them out (7x bloat + stale code shipped).

Rule: in `Invoke-Build`, before packing, move/exclude `*.bak*` from `$src` (or warn if `Get-ChildItem $src -Recurse -Include *.bak*` is non-empty). When verifying a PBO by text, COUNT occurrences (`Cnt`) instead of `Contains` - a `.bak` copy makes `Contains` lie. Cross-project convention: never leave `.bak_` in the mod's `scripts/`; put them in `<Mod>_dev\_backups\`. Cross-ref `dayz-pbo-build` (packaging). Origin: LFHeli feel-pass 2026-07-14 (cycle-16).

## Clean storage before any measurement boot - persisted entities re-fire EEInit (SP-062, added 2026-07-14)

Vehicles (and other persistent entities) saved in the mission's `storage_1` RE-RUN their `EEInit` on the next boot. Any logic ARMED there - a test `CallLater`, a JSON-driven spike/tuning mode, a countdown - re-fires on every persisted instance at once. Real case (LFHeli 2026-07-11): two helis from the day before re-armed their W0 spike at boot and flew off on their own after 60 s (two phantom CSV pairs contaminating the corpus, violating one-run-active-at-a-time; the user even saw them fly with no explanation).

Rule: before a boot meant for MEASUREMENT (cells, spikes, telemetry), the mission storage must be clean ALWAYS - rename `storage_1` -> `storage_1.bak_<date>_<reason>` (reversible), not only after a dirty kill. The current SOP only covers the dirty kill / stream-damage case (see `## TROUBLESHOOTING`). The rename also purges test entities accumulated from earlier sessions. Cross-ref `dayz-mcp-verify` (one-run-active protocol). Origin: LFHeli feel cells 2026-07-11 (storage renamed storage_1.bak_20260711_feelcells).

## DEVELOPER vs DIAG_DEVELOPER - the standard diag only defines DIAG_DEVELOPER (SP-033, added 2026-07-14)

The standard `DayZDiag_x64` defines `DIAG_DEVELOPER` but NOT `DEVELOPER` (bare). Verified in `script_*.log` of both peers: server/client defines include `DIAG,DIAG_DEVELOPER,...,FEATURE_NETWORK_RECONCILIATION` - no `DEVELOPER`. So every vanilla `#ifdef DEVELOPER` block (e.g. the debug get-in: `DayZPlayerSyncJunctures.SendGetInVehicle`, `SJ_DEBUG_GET_IN_VEHICLE`, `PlayerBase.TryGetInVehicleDebug`, much of `plugindeveloper.c`) does NOT exist in this build. `OnDebugSpawn` working (it is `#ifdef DIAG_DEVELOPER`) does NOT prove `DEVELOPER` is active - different macros.

Expensive trap: if a mod PBO EMITS a `#ifdef DEVELOPER` symbol (a call to `SendGetInVehicle`, etc.), the symbol does not exist -> HARD compile failure of the WHOLE PBO -> every tool/script of the mod drops. Not a silent no-op (unlike `ExecuteEnforceScript`, Developer-only, which returns false at runtime).

Rule before basing a design on a vanilla `#ifdef DEVELOPER` API: (1) grep the `#ifdef` guarding it (`DEVELOPER` or `DIAG_DEVELOPER`?); (2) if `DEVELOPER`, read the `defines:` line of a recent `script_*.log` for that build to confirm it is active; (3) if not, do NOT emit the symbol - wrapping it in `#ifdef DEVELOPER` is not "robustness" if the design DEPENDS on it; find a non-DEVELOPER path. Cross-ref `dayz-mod-workflow` (anti-confabulation). Origin: DayZ_MCP Fase 5 Tramo A (2026-06-28), compile logs of both profiles.
